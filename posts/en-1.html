          In this post, I will let you know steps to login into MonokaiToolkit.<br/><br/>
          First thing you have to make sure is the account you're going to login has been logged into this device at least once.
          If you don't try to login Facebook using your default browser. Otherwise, Facebook App is also acceptable.<br/><br/>
          Another thing to care about is if you don't use this device regularly, please be careful since it may cause Checkpoint.<br/>
          If you want a safe login method, please use <b>MonokaiToolkit 2 Extension (Chrome Extension)</b> and use <b>Login with QR</b> feature.
